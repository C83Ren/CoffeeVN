    # They arrived at the family restaurant. They took  their seats.
    # The place seems fairly crowded, nothing so much that you would call it packed.
    # “You can order anything you want” said Hitona.
    # Heard that Shiraishi asked back, “Can I order more than one?”
    # “Sure”.
    # The waitress came, Hitona ordered pasta and fries on the side.
    # Shiraishi then proceeded with ordering omellete rice, beef bowl, and hamburger steak.
    # When Hitona heard that her brain couldn’t processed it, when the waitress left then it clicked.
    # “Eeeeeeeh?! You’re going to eat all that?!”. Shiraishi just smiled
    # When the food came Shiraishi asked, “Hitona neechan can you eat one of these?”
    # “….EEEEH?!” With such face Hitona just couldn’t say no.
    # So which one will you choose?
