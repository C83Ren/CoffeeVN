    #Have a little chat, call senpai about the situation, senpai told her not to worry instead just play with the girl.
    #She said she’ll contact her again at a later time and made sure to tell Hitona to play with the young kid.
    #Hitona feels bad but she just followed what her senpai told her to do.
