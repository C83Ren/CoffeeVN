    p "(Maybe she’s lost?)"

    "??" "Eeeeeh? Noooo Shiraishi wants to play! Shiraishi wants to play with Onee-chaan!"

    p "(Ah, this kid is turning out to be more troublesome than I first thought…)"

    "It seems like her name is Shiraishi."

    "I’m at a loss about what to do. For now, I guess I’ll call senpai and ask her."
    
    p "Ah, okay, okay, give me a moment."
    
    p "Let me call my friend first."

    p "So there’s this girl..."

    "I told Senpai what had happened."

    sn "Ah, is that so? Then just go play with her! Don’t worry about me!"
    
    sn "We can always find another time to meet, no worries!"
    
    p "Eh?"

    sn "It’s more important for Kohi to play with her! But make sure to have fun with her, okay! If you don’t…"
    
    sn "You really don’t want to know what’s going to happen. Hehehe..."
    
    p "H...Huh…? O...Okay...I understand..."

    "At the corner of my vision, Shiraishi was looking up to me with a beaming smile. In any case it looks like I’ll be playing with her"

    p "So Shiraishi was it? Nee-chan will play with you~"

    show hitona1 happy1

    s "Yaaay! Let’s play Hitona Onee-chan!"

    p "Eh…? Huh? Yeah…so do you want to play in the park?"

    show hitona1 idle2

    s "No! Shiraishi want to go somewhere with many games!"

    p "You mean the game store?"

    s "No! A place where you put in coins and then play!"

    p "Oooh you mean the game center. Yeah sure, let’s go~"

    show hitona1 smile2

    "Shiraishi held my hand then we walked towards the gaming center"

    p "Shiraishi, how old are you again?"

    s "10 years old!"

    p "Do you usually wait for someone to play like this?"

    s "No, Shiraishi just feel like doing it today"

    s "After all, playing games can make anyone happy!"

    "I could only smile at her innocent response."

    p "(I wonder if I was that cheerful and innocent when I was 10 years old…)"

    p "And here we are the game center~"

    show hitona1 stareyes1

    "Shiraishi was standing by my side."

    "her eyes filled with excitement."

    "Unable to wait any longer, she let go of my hand and started heading inside without me."

    p "Oooi Shiraishi"

    "She seemed to be so entranced by the game center she couldn’t even hear my voice"

    "Shiraishi walked around the game center, admiring every machine there was."
    
    "I just quietly followed her without saying a word."

    show hitona1 sad1

    "She took a full round around the game center before realizing I wasn’t walking beside her anymore."

    "Realizing this, she stopped and looked around worriedly, but smiled again at our eyes."

    show hitona1 happy3

    "She tottered back to me and held my hand again."

    p "So what do you think of the game center?"

    s "It’s really fun!"

    p "We haven’t even tried anything though…"

    s "It’s still fun! Hitona onee-chan, let’s play something!"

    p "What should we play then?"

    show hitona1 idle2

    s "Hmmmm…"

    p "How about a racing game? There’s two of us, so it might be fun if we race against each other."

    s "Hmmm no…"

    p "Then how about the drum rhythm game? It’s fun listening to music as well!"

    s "Ummm... Shiraishi feels like playing something else though…"

    "Even though she was excited looking at everything, she’s unexpectedly picky."

    p "(Oh well, I’m not really good at those two games anyways.)"

    p "Well then…How about we try the crane game then?"

    show hitona1 stareyes4

    "As soon as I said that, Shiraishi was smiling ear to ear."

    s "Yess! Shiraishi wants to try that with Hitona onee-chan!"

    show hitona1 smile1

    "With that said, we started heading towards the crane games."

    "There were plushies, figurines, bags, all sorts of prizes."

    p "(Ah that’s right…)"

    p "Which one do you want to try, Shiraishi?"

    s "Hmmm…Shiraishi wants to look around first!"

    p "Okay, let’s have a look around then~"

    "We went from one machine to the next, looking at the different prizes."

    s "Ooooh this one is cute! That one is cute as well!"

    p "Yeah you’re right! This one over here is cute too!"

    "Shiraishi nodded vigorously"

    "And just like this, we spent an hour, but had yet to try even one."

    p "Hey, Shiraishi…we should pick one soon; we’ve been looking around for one hour already."

    show hitona1 idle2

    s "Hmmm…but they’re all so cute…"

    p "I know right! It’s such a dilemma! But we still have to pick one."

    p "After all, the trick with crane games is to pick a single one! It’s no good to try each machine one by one."

    "Shiraishi went into deep thought."

    p "How about that plushie over there? The white dog wearing the yellow shirt? The San**o character."

    show hitona1 smug1

    s "Shiraishi has decided!"

    p "Oh?"

    s "The one with the pretty lady!"

    "Shiraishi was pointing at the machine with bishoujo figurines."

    "It was a Hatsu** Miku figure with an orange jacket and green skirt. For some reason, it feels like I’ve won this one before."

    p "Eh? I totally thought you were going to choose one with a plushie."

    s "No! Shiraishi wants to play the one with the pretty lady!"

    p "Okay then, let’s try it!"

    "As soon as I went to insert the coin, memories flooded back…that struggle…the bitterness and the tears."

    p "(This is for Shiraishi sake! Let’s get the prize!)"

    p "Let’s GOO!"

    s "OOOOU!"

    "I put the first coin in."

    #Crane sfx

    "As the crane went down, Shiraishi was beside me staring with hopeful eyes and fidgeting…"

    "...but the crane didn’t even touch the prize."

    s "Don’t worry Hitona onee-chan! You’ll definitely get it the next time!"

    "Push!"

    "...Aah doesn’t seem like it’s gonna get it…I just sighed"

    s "Hitona nee-chan! We got it!!! Yaaaaaay!"

    p "Huh?! We got it???"

    "There it is, the prize. Shiraishi took it and showed it to me"

    "Shiraishi was looking something else now"
